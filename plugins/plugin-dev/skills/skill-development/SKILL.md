# Skill Development for Claude Code Plugins

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills for Claude Code plugins.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. "This skill should be used when..." instead of "Use this skill when...").

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/schema.md` for database schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for templates

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)

*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.

## Skill Creation Process

To create a skill, follow these six steps. For detailed instructions on each step, see `references/skill-creation-workflow.md`.

1. **Understand the Skill**: Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used through user questions and feedback
2. **Plan Reusable Contents**: Analyze examples to identify what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful
3. **Create Structure**: Set up the skill directory with `mkdir -p skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}`
4. **Edit the Skill**: Write SKILL.md with proper frontmatter and imperative-form body; create bundled resources
5. **Validate and Test**: Check structure, trigger phrases, writing style, and progressive disclosure
6. **Iterate**: Improve based on real-world usage and feedback

### Key Writing Guidelines

- **Description**: Use third-person ("This skill should be used when...") with specific trigger phrases
- **Body**: Use imperative/infinitive form ("To create X, do Y"), not second person ("You should...")
- **Size**: Target 1,500-2,000 words; move detailed content to references/

## Plugin-Specific Considerations

### Skill Location in Plugins

Plugin skills live in the plugin's `skills/` directory:

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── commands/
├── agents/
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── references/
        ├── examples/
        └── scripts/
```

### Auto-Discovery

Claude Code automatically discovers skills:

- Scans `skills/` directory
- Finds subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
- Loads skill metadata (name + description) always
- Loads SKILL.md body when skill triggers
- Loads references/examples when needed

### No Packaging Needed

Plugin skills are distributed as part of the plugin, not as separate ZIP files. Users get skills when they install the plugin.

### Testing in Plugins

Test skills by installing plugin locally:

```bash
# Test with --plugin-dir
cc --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin

# Ask questions that should trigger the skill
# Verify skill loads correctly
```

## Examples from Plugin-Dev

Study the skills in this plugin as examples of best practices:

**hook-development skill:**

- Excellent trigger phrases: "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse hook", etc.
- Lean SKILL.md (1,651 words)
- 3 references/ files for detailed content
- 3 examples/ of working hooks
- 3 scripts/ utilities

**agent-development skill:**

- Strong triggers: "create an agent", "agent frontmatter", etc.
- Focused SKILL.md (1,438 words)
- References include the AI generation prompt from Claude Code
- Complete agent examples

**plugin-settings skill:**

- Specific triggers: "plugin settings", ".local.md files", "YAML frontmatter"
- References show real implementations (multi-agent-swarm, ralph-wiggum)
- Working parsing scripts

Each demonstrates progressive disclosure and strong triggering.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing a skill:

**Structure:**

- [ ] SKILL.md file exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Frontmatter has `name` and `description` fields
- [ ] Markdown body is present and substantial
- [ ] Referenced files actually exist

**Description Quality:**

- [ ] Uses third person ("This skill should be used when...")
- [ ] Includes specific trigger phrases users would say
- [ ] Lists concrete scenarios ("create X", "configure Y")

**Content Quality:**

- [ ] SKILL.md body uses imperative/infinitive form
- [ ] Body is focused and lean (1,500-2,000 words ideal, <3k max)
- [ ] Detailed content moved to references/
- [ ] Examples are complete and working

**Testing:**

- [ ] Skill triggers on expected user queries
- [ ] Content is helpful for intended tasks
- [ ] No duplicated information across files

## Best Practices Summary

**DO:**

- Include specific trigger phrases ("create X", "configure Y")
- Keep SKILL.md lean (1,500-2,000 words)
- Use progressive disclosure (move details to references/)

- Reference supporting files clearly
- Provide working examples
- Create utility scripts for common operations

**DON'T:**

- Use second person ("You should...")
- Have vague trigger conditions
- Put everything in SKILL.md (>3,000 words without references/)
