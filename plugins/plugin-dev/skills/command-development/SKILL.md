# Command Development for Claude Code

## Overview

Slash commands are frequently-used prompts defined as Markdown files that Claude executes during interactive sessions. Master command structure, frontmatter options, and dynamic features to create powerful, reusable workflows.

**Key concepts:**

- Markdown file format for commands
- YAML frontmatter for configuration
- Dynamic arguments and file references
- Bash execution for context
- Command organization and namespacing

## Command Basics

### What is a Slash Command?

A slash command is a Markdown file containing a prompt that Claude executes when invoked. Commands provide:

- **Reusability**: Define once, use repeatedly
- **Consistency**: Standardize common workflows
- **Sharing**: Distribute across team or projects
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to complex prompts

### Critical: Commands are Instructions FOR Claude

**Commands are written for agent consumption, not human consumption.**

When a user invokes `/command-name`, the command content becomes Claude's instructions. Write commands as directives TO Claude about what to do, not as messages TO the user.

**Correct approach (instructions for Claude):**

```markdown
Review this code for security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- Authentication issues

Provide specific line numbers and severity ratings.
```

**Incorrect approach (messages to user):**

```markdown
This command will review your code for security issues.
You'll receive a report with vulnerability details.
```

The first example tells Claude what to do. The second tells the user what will happen but doesn't instruct Claude. Always use the first approach.

### Command Locations

**Project commands** (shared with team):

- Location: `.claude/commands/`
- Scope: Available in specific project
- Label: Shown as "(project)" in `/help`
- Use for: Team workflows, project-specific tasks

**Personal commands** (available everywhere):

- Location: `~/.claude/commands/`
- Scope: Available in all projects
- Label: Shown as "(user)" in `/help`
- Use for: Personal workflows, cross-project utilities

**Plugin commands** (bundled with plugins):

- Location: `plugin-name/commands/`
- Scope: Available when plugin installed
- Label: Shown as "(plugin-name)" in `/help`
- Use for: Plugin-specific functionality

## File Format

### Basic Structure

Commands are Markdown files with `.md` extension:

```
.claude/commands/
├── review.md           # /review command
├── test.md             # /test command
└── deploy.md           # /deploy command
```

**Simple command:**

```markdown
Review this code for security vulnerabilities including:
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- Authentication bypass
- Insecure data handling
```

No frontmatter needed for basic commands.

### With YAML Frontmatter

Add configuration using YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Review code for security issues
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Bash(git:*)
model: sonnet
---

Review this code for security vulnerabilities...
```

## YAML Frontmatter Fields

### description

**Purpose:** Brief description shown in `/help`
**Type:** String
**Default:** First line of command prompt

```yaml
---
description: Review pull request for code quality
---
```

**Best practice:** Clear, actionable description (under 60 characters)

### allowed-tools

**Purpose:** Specify which tools command can use
**Type:** String or Array
**Default:** Inherits from conversation

```yaml
---
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash(git:*)
---
```

**Patterns:**

- `Read, Write, Edit` - Specific tools
- `Bash(git:*)` - Bash with git commands only
- `*` - All tools (rarely needed)

**Use when:** Command requires specific tool access

### model

**Purpose:** Specify model for command execution
**Type:** String (sonnet, opus, haiku)
**Default:** Inherits from conversation

```yaml
---
model: haiku
---
```

**Use cases:**

- `haiku` - Fast, simple commands
- `sonnet` - Standard workflows
- `opus` - Complex analysis

### argument-hint

**Purpose:** Document expected arguments for autocomplete
**Type:** String
**Default:** None

```yaml
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
---
```

**Benefits:**

- Helps users understand command arguments
- Improves command discovery
- Documents command interface

### disable-model-invocation

**Purpose:** Prevent SlashCommand tool from programmatically calling command
**Type:** Boolean
**Default:** false

```yaml
---
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

**Use when:** Command should only be manually invoked

## Dynamic Arguments

### Using $ARGUMENTS

Capture all arguments as single string:

```markdown
---
description: Fix issue by number
argument-hint: [issue-number]
---

Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards and best practices.
```

**Usage:**

```
> /fix-issue 123
> /fix-issue 456
```

**Expands to:**

```
Fix issue #123 following our coding standards...
Fix issue #456 following our coding standards...
```

### Using Positional Arguments

Capture individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.:

```markdown
---
description: Review PR with priority and assignee
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
---

Review pull request #$1 with priority level $2.
After review, assign to $3 for follow-up.
```

**Usage:**

```
> /review-pr 123 high alice
```

**Expands to:**

```
Review pull request #123 with priority level high.
After review, assign to alice for follow-up.
```

### Combining Arguments

Mix positional and remaining arguments:

```markdown
Deploy $1 to $2 environment with options: $3
```

**Usage:**

```
> /deploy api staging --force --skip-tests
```

**Expands to:**

```
Deploy api to staging environment with options: --force --skip-tests
```

## File References

### Using @ Syntax

Include file contents in command:

```markdown
---
description: Review specific file
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

Review @$1 for:
- Code quality
- Best practices
- Potential bugs
```

**Usage:**

```
> /review-file src/api/users.ts
```

**Effect:** Claude reads `src/api/users.ts` before processing command

### Multiple File References

Reference multiple files:

```markdown
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js

Identify:
- Breaking changes
- New features
- Bug fixes
```

### Static File References

Reference known files without arguments:

```markdown
Review @package.json and @tsconfig.json for consistency

Ensure:
- TypeScript version matches
- Dependencies are aligned
- Build configuration is correct
```

## Bash Execution in Commands

Commands can execute bash commands inline to dynamically gather context before Claude processes the command. This is useful for including repository state, environment information, or project-specific context.

**When to use:**

- Include dynamic context (git status, environment vars, etc.)
- Gather project/repository state
- Build context-aware workflows

**Implementation details:**
For complete syntax, examples, and best practices, see `references/plugin-features-reference.md` section on bash execution. The reference includes the exact syntax and multiple working examples to avoid execution issues

## Command Organization

### Flat Structure

Simple organization for small command sets:

```
.claude/commands/
├── build.md
├── test.md
├── deploy.md
├── review.md
└── docs.md
```

**Use when:** 5-15 commands, no clear categories

### Namespaced Structure

Organize commands in subdirectories:

```
.claude/commands/
├── ci/
│   ├── build.md        # /build (project:ci)
│   ├── test.md         # /test (project:ci)
│   └── lint.md         # /lint (project:ci)
├── git/
│   ├── commit.md       # /commit (project:git)
│   └── pr.md           # /pr (project:git)
└── docs/
    ├── generate.md     # /generate (project:docs)
    └── publish.md      # /publish (project:docs)
```

**Benefits:**

- Logical grouping by category
- Namespace shown in `/help`
- Easier to find related commands

**Use when:** 15+ commands, clear categories

## Best Practices

### Command Design

1. **Single responsibility:** One command, one task
2. **Clear descriptions:** Self-explanatory in `/help`
3. **Explicit dependencies:** Use `allowed-tools` when needed
4. **Document arguments:** Always provide `argument-hint`
5. **Consistent naming:** Use verb-noun pattern (review-pr, fix-issue)

### Argument Handling

1. **Validate arguments:** Check for required arguments in prompt
2. **Provide defaults:** Suggest defaults when arguments missing
3. **Document format:** Explain expected argument format
4. **Handle edge cases:** Consider missing or invalid arguments

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [pr-number]
---

$IF($1,
  Review PR #$1,
  Please provide a PR number. Usage: /review-pr [number]
)
```

### File References

1. **Explicit paths:** Use clear file paths
2. **Check existence:** Handle missing files gracefully
3. **Relative paths:** Use project-relative paths
4. **Glob support:** Consider using Glob tool for patterns

### Bash Commands

1. **Limit scope:** Use `Bash(git:*)` not `Bash(*)`
2. **Safe commands:** Avoid destructive operations
3. **Handle errors:** Consider command failures
4. **Keep fast:** Long-running commands slow invocation

### Documentation

1. **Add comments:** Explain complex logic
2. **Provide examples:** Show usage in comments
3. **List requirements:** Document dependencies
4. **Version commands:** Note breaking changes

## Common Patterns

### Review Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Review code changes
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(git:*)
---

Files changed: `git diff --name-only`

Review each file for code quality, bugs, test coverage, documentation needs.
```

### Testing Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Run tests for specific file
argument-hint: [test-file]
allowed-tools: Bash(npm:*)
---

Run tests: `npm test $1`
Analyze results and suggest fixes for failures.
```

### Workflow Pattern

```markdown
---
description: Complete PR workflow
argument-hint: [pr-number]
allowed-tools: Bash(gh:*), Read
---

PR #$1 Workflow:
1. Fetch PR: `gh pr view $1`
2. Review changes
3. Run checks
4. Approve or request changes
```

## Troubleshooting

**Command not appearing:**

- Check file is in correct directory
- Verify `.md` extension present
- Ensure valid Markdown format
- Restart Claude Code

**Arguments not working:**

- Verify `$1`, `$2` syntax correct
- Check `argument-hint` matches usage
- Ensure no extra spaces

**Bash execution failing:**

- Check `allowed-tools` includes Bash
- Verify command syntax in backticks
- Test command in terminal first
- Check for required permissions

**File references not working:**

- Verify `@` syntax correct
- Check file path is valid
- Ensure Read tool allowed
- Use absolute or project-relative paths

## Plugin-Specific Features

### CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT Variable

Plugin commands have access to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, an environment variable that resolves to the plugin's absolute path.

**Purpose:**

- Reference plugin files portably
- Execute plugin scripts
- Load plugin configuration
- Access plugin templates

**Basic usage:**

```markdown
---
description: Analyze using plugin script
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*)
---

Run analysis: `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/analyze.js $1`

Review results and report findings.
```

**Common patterns:**

```markdown
# Execute plugin script
`bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/script.sh`

# Load plugin configuration
@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/settings.json

# Use plugin template
@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/report.md

# Access plugin resources
@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/reference.md
```

**Why use it:**

- Works across all installations
- Portable between systems
- No hardcoded paths needed
- Essential for multi-file plugins

### Plugin Command Organization

Plugin commands discovered automatically from `commands/` directory:

```
plugin-name/
├── commands/
│   ├── foo.md              # /foo (plugin:plugin-name)
│   ├── bar.md              # /bar (plugin:plugin-name)
│   └── utils/
│       └── helper.md       # /helper (plugin:plugin-name:utils)
└── plugin.json
```

**Namespace benefits:**

- Logical command grouping
- Shown in `/help` output
- Avoid name conflicts
- Organize related commands

**Naming conventions:**

- Use descriptive action names
- Avoid generic names (test, run)
- Consider plugin-specific prefix
- Use hyphens for multi-word names

### Plugin Command Patterns

**Configuration-based pattern:**

```markdown
---
description: Deploy using plugin configuration
argument-hint: [environment]
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(*)
---

Load configuration: @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/$1-deploy.json

Deploy to $1 using configuration settings.
Monitor deployment and report status.
```

**Template-based pattern:**

```markdown
---
description: Generate docs from template
argument-hint: [component]
---

Template: @${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/docs.md

Generate documentation for $1 following template structure.
```

**Multi-script pattern:**

```markdown
---
description: Complete build workflow
allowed-tools: Bash(*)
---

Build: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build.sh`
Test: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/test.sh`
Package: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/package.sh`

Review outputs and report workflow status.
```

**See `references/plugin-features-reference.md` for detailed patterns.**

## Integration with Plugin Components

Commands integrate with other plugin components for powerful workflows:

- **Agents**: Launch plugin agents for complex tasks (agent must exist in `plugin/agents/`)
- **Skills**: Leverage plugin skills for specialized knowledge (mention skill name to trigger)
- **Hooks**: Coordinate with hooks that execute on tool events
- **Multi-component**: Combine agents, skills, and scripts in phased workflows

**See `references/plugin-integration.md` for detailed patterns and examples.**

## Validation Patterns

Commands should validate inputs and resources before processing:

- **Argument validation**: Check required arguments match expected values
- **File existence**: Verify files exist before processing
- **Plugin resources**: Validate scripts and configs are present
- **Error handling**: Capture failures and provide helpful messages

**Best practices:** Validate early, provide helpful errors, suggest corrections.

**See `references/plugin-integration.md` for validation examples.**
